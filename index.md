**Hi there**, 

I am Fabio Ellger, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Transformations of Democracy Unit](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/transformations-of-democracy) at WZB Berlin Social Science Center, directed by Daniel Ziblatt. In 2022, I was a Visiting Fellow at the [Center for European Studies](https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/people/fabio-ellger) at Harvard University. Earlier that year, I obtained my doctoral degree at the Chair of Comparative Political Behavior at Humboldt University and graduated from a joint PhD program with the Hertie School.

I am interested in Comparative Politics and Political Behavior. In my projects, I utilize quantitative analyses, experiments, or design-based inference to investigate challenges of today's democracies. My research focuses primarily on representation, participation and polarization and has been published in the _Journal of Politics_. My [research page](/research/) gives an overview of ongoing and completed projects. I also enjoy [teaching](/teaching/) classes on political behavior, research design and applied research methods.

You can find a current version of my [CV here.](https://www.fabioellger.com/assets/docs/CV_Ellger.pdf)
