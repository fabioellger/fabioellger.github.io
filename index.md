**Hi there**, 

I am Fabio Ellger, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Transformations of Democracy Unit](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/transformations-of-democracy) at WZB Berlin, directed by Daniel Ziblatt. 
In 2022, I was a Visiting Fellow at the [Center for European Studies](https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/people/fabio-ellger) at Harvard University. Earlier that year, I obtained my doctoral degree at the [Chair of Comparative Political Behavior](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/team-comparative-political-behavior) at Humboldt University and graduated from [Dynamics](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/people/Alumni), a joint PhD program with the Hertie School.

I am interested in Comparative Politics and Political Behavior. In my projects, I employ a range of quantitative analyses, such as experiments or quasi-experimental designs, to learn more about challenges of today's democracies.
My primary research focus is on representation, participation and polarization. Studies in these areas have been published in the _Journal of Politics_ and _Comparative Political Studies_, amongst others.  My [publications & research page](/research/) gives a detailed overview of ongoing projects and published work.
I also enjoy [teaching](/teaching/) classes on political behavior, research design and applied research methods.

A current version of my [CV is available here.](https://www.fabioellger.com/assets/docs/CV_Ellger.pdf)
