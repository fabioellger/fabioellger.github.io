**Hi there**, 

I am Fabio Ellger, a PhD Student at [HU Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/fabio-ellger/fabio-ellger?set_language=en) with strong interest in Comparative Politics and Political Behavior. I use quantitative analyses, experiments, or design-based inference to tackle questions connected to representation, participation, and polarization in today's democracies.

Here is a current version of my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/98esjxiqbu577gx/CV_Ellger.pdf?dl=0)
