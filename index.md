**Welcome,** 

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [WZB Transformations of Democracy Unit](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/transformations-of-democracy), directed by Daniel Ziblatt. 
I am interested in Comparative Politics and Political Behavior, with a focus on challenges to contemporary democracies. 
My primary research areas cover democratic representation, participation and voter mobilization. 
I also study the emergence of societal and electoral polarization, as well as their implication for democratic governance and resilience.  

As a postdoc, I visited Nuffield College at the University of Oxford (Summer 2024) and the [Center for European Studies](https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/people/fabio-ellger) at Harvard University (Fall 2022). 
In 2022, I obtained my doctoral degree at the [Chair of Comparative Political Behavior](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/team-comparative-political-behavior) of Humboldt University Berlin and graduated from [DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/people/Alumni) -- a joint PhD program of Humboldt University and the Hertie School.

My work has been published in journals such as the _Journal of Politics_, _British Journal of Political Science_, _Comparative Political Studies_, and _West European Politics_. 
In my research, I employ a broad range of empirical methods, such as field and survey experiments, quasi-experimental designs, and quantitative text analyses with large language models.
For a comprehensive overview of my ongoing projects and previous publications, please visit my [Research](/research/) page.

 I also enjoy [teaching](/teaching/) classes on political behavior, research design and applied research methods.
