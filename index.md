**Hi there**, 

I am Fabio Ellger, a Researcher at the new 'Transformations of Democracy' Unit at [WZB Berlin](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/transformations-of-democracy/people) and a PhD Candidate at the [Chair of Comparative Political Behavior](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/the-chair?set_language=en) at HU Berlin.


I am interested in Comparative Politics and Political Behavior and utilize quantitative analyses, experiments, or design-based inference to investigate questions connected to representation, participation, and polarization in today's democracies. My [research page](/research/) gives a brief overview of ongoing and completed projects. I also enjoy [teaching](/teaching/) classes on political behavior, research design, and applied research methods.
