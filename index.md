**Hi there**, 

I am Fabio Ellger, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the new [Transformations of Democracy Unit](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/transformations-of-democracy) at WZB Berlin Social Science Center. I obtained my PhD at the [Chair of Comparative Political Behavior](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/the-chair?set_language=en) at Humboldt University Berlin.


I am interested in Comparative Politics and Political Behavior. In my research projects, I utilize quantitative analyses, experiments, or design-based inference to investigate questions connected to representation, participation, and polarization in today's democracies. My [research page](/research/) gives a brief overview of ongoing and completed projects. I also enjoy [teaching](/teaching/) classes on political behavior, research design, and applied research methods.
