**Welcome,** 

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [WZB Transformations of Democracy Unit](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/transformations-of-democracy), directed by Daniel Ziblatt. 
I am interested in Comparative Politics and Political Behavior, with a focus on challenges to contemporary democracies. 
My primary research areas cover democratic representation, participation and voter mobilization. 
I also study the emergence of polarization and its implications for democratic governance and resilience.  

As a postdoc, I visited Nuffield College at the University of Oxford (Summer 2024) and the [Center for European Studies](https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/people/fabio-ellger) at Harvard University (Fall 2022). 
In 2022, I obtained my doctoral degree at the [Chair of Comparative Political Behavior](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/team-comparative-political-behavior) of Humboldt University Berlin and graduated from [DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/people/Alumni) -- a joint PhD program of Humboldt University and the Hertie School.

My work has been published in leading peer-reviewed journals, including  the __Journal of Politics__, __British Journal of Political Science__, __Comparative Political Studies__, and __West European Politics__.
 My research has received recognition in the form of the _Gordon Smith and Vincent Wright Memorial Prize (2025)_ for outstanding work appearing in West European Politics
Methodologically, I employ field and survey experiments, quasi-experimental designs, and quantitative text analysis using large language models.
For a comprehensive overview of my ongoing projects and previous publications, please visit my [Research](/research/) page.

 I also enjoy [teaching](/teaching/) classes on political behavior, research design and applied research methods.
